# 🏥 Upside-Down Healthcare System — Hospital Performance Analysis

## 📖 Project Overview
A hospital performance analysis using synthetic healthcare data from Kaggle.  
The goal was to assess care quality and efficiency through key KPIs — **Readmission Rate, Complication Rate, Success Rate, and Average Length of Stay (LOS)** — across hospitals, departments, and demographics.  
The project revealed shocking patterns: some hospitals reached **>60% complication rates**, teenage patients showed the **lowest success outcomes**, and LOS had **no correlation** with quality — an “upside-down” healthcare world.

## ⚙️ Tools & Methods
- **SQL (SQLite / DBeaver):** Data cleaning, KPI calculations, and trend analysis  
- **Excel:** Data validation and sanity checks  
- **Tableau (planned):** For upcoming visualization phase  
- **ETL & Data Quality:** Ensured completeness, consistency, and anonymization compliance  

## 📊 Key Findings
1. PLC Thomas and Ltd Brown hospitals showed **critical complication rates (>66%)**  
2. Asthma treatments performed best (34.26% success) while arthritis had the poorest outcomes (32.57%)  
3. **Teenage females** were the most vulnerable group (25.45% success rate)  
4. **LOS ≠ Quality:** Longer stays didn’t improve outcomes  
5. Costs remained similar across insurance types — inequity lies in quality, not price  

## 💡 Strategic Insights
- Immediate audit recommended for low-performing hospitals  
- Develop specialized adolescent-care programs  
- Strengthen emergency-care protocols  
- Continuous performance monitoring via dashboards  

## 🔒 Data Ethics
All data are **synthetic and anonymized** (Kaggle dataset).  
No personal or identifiable information was used.  
Analysis followed ethical standards aligned with HIPAA principles for synthetic data.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Build Tableau dashboard visualizing KPI gaps  
- Extend to predictive modeling for early risk detection
